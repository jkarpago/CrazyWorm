# CrazyWorm
Simple test game for blinks
This is my first test game for blinks and my first time with arduino so I now the code must be much more better than is right now

CrazyWorm is a (competitive/solo) game where you have to drive your worm the fastest way you can to the finish line.
The worm has a fece where random colors appear and a back where only one color shows and you have to move the back to the face to move forward.
The color on the back is a random pick from the 3 face colors: front, left, right. You can rotate those colors according the chances you configure previous the game.
